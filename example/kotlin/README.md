FalCAuN Examples with Kotlin
============================

This directory contains examples to directly execute FalCAuN via Kotlin. Our examples depends on [kscript](https://github.com/kscripting/kscript) to execute the examples.

Usage
-----

To execute the examples, you need to install kscript first. Then, please install FalCAuN using the following commands at the root of FalCAuN.

```bash
mvn clean --projects matlab
mvn install
```

After that, you can directly execute the example scripts, for example, `./ATS1.kts`.
